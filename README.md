# Arduino-LDR-Application

## Description
This project utilizes the Arduino ESP32 Espressif to create a light-sensing IoT device to automatically upload sensor readings to an app. 

## Prerequisites
### Hardware
For this project, it is necessary to acquire a microcontroller which is programmable by the Arduino IDE and compatible with the ESP32 Espressif and wifi.

The device presented in this project is the [Adafruit HUZZAH32 - ESP32 Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/overview).

### Software
The [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) will be needed in order to program the IoT device. Along with this, the [Thinger.io](https://github.com/thinger-io/Arduino-Library) arduino library should be added.
